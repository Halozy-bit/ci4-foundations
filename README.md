# CodeIgniter 4 Foundations Code Samples

This is the repository for all of the code samples for my book, CodeIgniter 4 Foundations. Views have been updated with Bootstrap styles to make it a little more exciting, but otherwise it is direct from the code examples in the book. 

## Running the samples

Each chapter is placed in its own directory, i.e. `project-01`, `project-01`, etc. To run the samples, navigate to the project folder on the command line and type:

> php spark serve

That will fire up the built-in web server and you should be able to view the site at `http://localhost:8080`. 

Some examples will require you to setup a database in order for it to work. Follow the directions in the [user guide](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/index.html) to get that setup, and be sure to run any Seeders or Migrations that project might have.
